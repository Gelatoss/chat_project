This program was created using JetBrains Rider, so it is recommended to open it in the same program, as we cannot guarantee how it will behave in other programs.
The program works by entering a keyword into the textbox and then clicking the send button. This action will generate an output displayed on the main window.
To ensure that the images are displayed correctly, the Build action and Copy to output directory properties should be set to "Resource" and "Copy always," respectively. These settings have already been configured appropriately, however, they are mentioned here as a precautionary measure in case the images do not appear as intended.
The "Help" and "About" buttons are not clickable; instead, a tooltip will appear when you hover your mouse over them. However, the "Fun" button, in addition to displaying a tooltip, can also be pressed to trigger a specific event.
